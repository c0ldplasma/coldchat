# CLAUDE.md

ColdChat — a Flutter Twitch chat client, [c0ldplasma/coldchat](https://github.com/c0ldplasma/coldchat). The Dart package
is `coldchat`.
Ships as `com.plasmari.coldchat` (Apple team `RA25PYVUTF`), which is **not** the same app as upstream.

ColdChat supports **Android and iOS only**. Desktop and web support was removed; don't recreate the
`windows/`, `macos/`, `linux/` or `web/` folders.

`analysis_options.yaml` excludes `build/`, `android/` and `ios/`. Flutter itself adds an exclude for every
platform folder that exists before each command (`AnalysisOptionsMigration` in flutter_tools), so a stray
platform folder shows up as a change to this file.

This file documents the build, install and release procedures. Everything below has been run and verified
on macOS with Xcode 26.5 / Flutter 3.47.8 (stable).

**Flutter 3.47.8 / Dart 3.13.7 is the minimum** (enforced in `pubspec.yaml`). Older SDKs are affected by
[GHSA-frr6-h895-5pxp](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-frr6-h895-5pxp): `dart:io` on
Android trusts compromised eMudhra intermediate CAs, which allows TLS MitM of e.g. the Twitch token.

## Localization

`lib/l10n/app_localizations*.dart` is **generated but checked in**. After editing any `lib/l10n/*.arb`:

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

Add new strings to `app_en.arb` (the template, see `l10n.yaml`) and `app_de.arb`. The other ~21 locales
fall back to English; translations for those are managed via Crowdin (`crowdin.yml`). Which strings they
are missing is written to `build/untranslated_messages.json` instead of being printed on every build.

## Versioning

`pubspec.yaml`'s `version: <name>+<build>` on `main` is always the **last release**. Flutter maps it to
`CFBundleShortVersionString`/`CFBundleVersion` on iOS and `versionName`/`versionCode` on Android.

- **Version name** is semver, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Bump MINOR for a release with new features, PATCH for
  a fix-only release, MAJOR only for big breaks. Never go below an already uploaded version: App Store
  Connect rejects a version lower than an approved one.
- **Build number** is one global counter shared by iOS and Android. It only ever goes up and is **never**
  reset when the version name changes. Every upload needs a number no earlier upload has used.
- 2.0.0 builds up to +119 went to TestFlight and local test installs went up to +123, so ColdChat's own
  versioning starts at **2.1.0+124**.

A release is one commit on `main` that sets the new version, followed by a tag and a GitHub release:

```bash
# pubspec.yaml:  version: 2.2.0+125
git commit -m "Release 2.2.0 (125)" pubspec.yaml
git tag v2.2.0+125 && git push origin main v2.2.0+125
gh release create v2.2.0+125 --repo c0ldplasma/coldchat --generate-notes --title "2.2.0 (125)"
```

Then build and upload from that commit (TestFlight and APK below). `--generate-notes` builds the changelog
from the PR titles merged since the previous release tag.

**Test builds never edit `pubspec.yaml`.** To tell a local install apart, pass the number at build time
instead, e.g. `flutter build ios --release --build-number=126`. Use a number above the last release, and
remember the next real release then has to go above it too.

The app shows its version and build at the bottom of Settings (`package_info_plus`), which makes it easy
to see which build a bug report is about.

## Analyze and build warnings

`flutter analyze` is **clean** — keep it at "No issues found!". `flutter build apk` and `flutter build ios`
also run without warnings; treat any new one as something to fix, not as noise.

`ColorScheme.surfaceVariant` is deprecated, and its replacement `surfaceContainerHighest` is a different
tone. Use `AppColors.of(context).surfaceVariant` (`lib/tools/m3parser.dart`), which reproduces the old color.

Gotcha: `ConnectionState` collides with Flutter's own `ConnectionState` from `package:flutter/material.dart`.
In any widget file, import the TMI one with a prefix:

```dart
import '../tmi/connection/connection_state.dart' as tmi;
```

## iOS — install on a connected iPhone without wiping app data

**Never use `flutter install` for this.** It calls `installApp(uninstall: true)`, which uninstalls the
existing app first and takes all Hive boxes with it (accounts, channels, settings, emote cache, seen
mentions). Use `devicectl`, which does an in-place upgrade and preserves the data container.

```bash
# 1. Find the device. Wireless discovery of unreachable paired devices can time out and
#    hide the attached one, so restrict to attached and allow a longer timeout.
flutter devices --device-connection attached --device-timeout 30

# 2. Build, codesigned (automatic signing, team RA25PYVUTF from the Xcode project).
flutter build ios --release

# 3. Install in place. Data is preserved because the bundle ID and signing team are unchanged.
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <UDID> build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app

# 4. Verify which build actually landed.
xcrun devicectl device info apps --device <UDID> | grep -i coldchat
```

Pass `--build-number=<N>` to step 2 if you want to tell the new install apart from the old one (see
Versioning; don't edit `pubspec.yaml` for this). Otherwise step 4 shows the same version and proves nothing.

Data survives an in-place upgrade only while the bundle ID and signing identity stay the same. Changing
either makes iOS refuse the install outright (it fails, it does not silently wipe), and the only way
forward is delete + install, which loses the data.

## iOS — TestFlight release

Prerequisites, one time: an app-specific password from
appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords (the regular Apple ID password does not
work), stored in the keychain. Note the `--item` flag — `altool`'s own `--help` omits it and the documented
form fails with `Expected item argument is missing, --item`:

```bash
xcrun altool --store-password-in-keychain-item --item COLDCHAT_ASC \
  -u <apple-id> -p <app-specific-password>
```

Never paste that password into a chat, a script, or a commit. To recover which Apple ID the item belongs to:

```bash
security find-generic-password -l COLDCHAT_ASC | grep '"acct"'
```

Then, per release:

```bash
# 1. Make the release commit and tag (see Versioning). A build number can never be
#    reused once App Store Connect has accepted it.

# 2. Archive + export an App Store IPA. ios/ExportOptions.plist is ours
#    (method: app-store-connect, teamID: RA25PYVUTF).
flutter build ipa --export-options-plist=ios/ExportOptions.plist
# -> build/ios/ipa/ColdChat.ipa, build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive

# 3. Validate FIRST. Catches a missing app record, bad entitlements or a duplicate
#    build number without consuming the build number.
xcrun altool --validate-app --type ios -f build/ios/ipa/ColdChat.ipa \
  -u <apple-id> -p "@env:ASC_PW"

# 4. Upload.
xcrun altool --upload-app --type ios -f build/ios/ipa/ColdChat.ipa \
  -u <apple-id> -p "@env:ASC_PW"
```

For steps 3 and 4, supply the password from the keychain per-command so it never lands in your shell
history, in `ps` output, or in a transcript:

```bash
ASC_PW="$(security find-generic-password -l COLDCHAT_ASC -w)" xcrun altool --upload-app ... -p "@env:ASC_PW"
```

`-p "@keychain:COLDCHAT_ASC"` looks like the obvious alternative but **does not work** with Xcode 26.5's
`altool`: it stores the item under `--item <name>` and then fails to find it, with
`AuthenticationFailure("Failed to find item COLDCHAT_ASC ...")`. The `@env:` route above is the workaround.

Expect one non-blocking warning: `MinimumOSVersion too low ... 13.0` (90068). From Spring 2027 App Store
Connect requires 15.0+, so the deployment target needs raising before then. Processing on Apple's side
takes a few minutes after `UPLOAD SUCCEEDED` before the build appears in TestFlight.

Uploading is irreversible — a build can be expired in TestFlight but its number is spent.

## Android — APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
# -> build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk  (~65 MB universal APK)
```

**This APK is signed with the debug keystore.** `android/app/build.gradle.kts` has
`release { signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("debug") }`. It sideloads and runs fine, but it cannot
go to Play, and its signature will not match a properly signed build later — switching keys requires an
uninstall, which wipes app data. Wiring up a real release keystore is still an open task.

`flutter build appbundle` would produce a Play-ready `.aab`, but only once the signing config is fixed.

## Repo gotchas

- `origin` is `c0ldplasma/coldchat` (push here, open PRs against its `main`). It is public — keep Apple IDs,
  device UDIDs, passwords and API keys out of committed files.
- ColdChat talks only to Twitch and the emote/badge/upload services it names in `lib/api/`. User cards and the
  channel header come from Helix (`Twitch.profile`, needs a login); the chatter list and `@` autocomplete use
  `Channel.recentChatters`, the people who wrote in the loaded chat, because Twitch only gives the full viewer
  list to the channel's moderators.
- `*.g.dart` files (json_serializable, Hive adapters) are **generated and not tracked**. After a fresh checkout or
  after changing an annotated model, run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
- Twitch login uses ColdChat's own **public** Twitch app (`twitchClientId` in `lib/modal/oauth_webview.dart`),
  with the redirect `https://localhost/` exactly as registered in the dev.twitch.tv console, trailing slash
  included. The web view intercepts that redirect, so no page is loaded.
- The iOS project uses **Swift Package Manager only**; CocoaPods was removed (no `Podfile`). Don't run
  `pod install`. `android/` and `ios/` are tracked, because the AGPL requires publishing everything needed to build
  the shipped app. Their own `.gitignore` files keep generated files and signing keys out; never commit a keystore,
  `key.properties` or anything with an Apple ID in it.
- The app font is **Google Sans Flex** (OFL, `fonts/OFL.txt`), a variable font. `M3Parser.fontVariations` narrows it
  to look like the Product Sans used before. Don't add a `wght` variation there: it overrides `FontWeight`, and bold
  text stops being bold. Product Sans itself is proprietary and must not be bundled.
- Settings → About shows the AGPL notices and links the source of the installed build by its release tag.
- `build/` is currently untracked but present in the working tree; don't commit it.
- Twitch login uses the OAuth **implicit grant** (`response_type=token` in `lib/modal/oauth_webview.dart`),
  so there is no refresh token and an expired login can only be fixed by signing in again. See
  `lib/widgets/login_expired_banner.dart` and `Client.validateCredentials`.
